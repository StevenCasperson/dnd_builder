## What is this website?
This is a web-based Dungeons & Dragons 5e character builder. It guides users through the entire process of creating a D&D character, from rolling stats to picking spells, and generates a printable PDF character sheet at the end.

## Features & Why They Matter
- **Step-by-step character creation:** Makes the process easy for beginners and thorough for veterans.
- **Interactive forms with validation:** Prevents mistakes and ensures a smooth experience.
- **Custom ability score rolling:** Follows popular house rules for more fun and fairness.
- **Equipment and spell selection with budget tracking:** Keeps choices within game rules and helps new players.
- **Beautiful, medieval-inspired UI:** Immerses users in the fantasy theme.
- **PDF export:** Lets you print or save your finished character for real-life play.

These features were chosen to make character creation accessible, error-free, and enjoyable for all D&D players.
